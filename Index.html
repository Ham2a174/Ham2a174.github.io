    <h3>My Java Game: Football Mania</h3>
    <p>
   For my first java programming project i created a game centered around the theme of football in which you the user controls a footballer who has to score goals inside the goal nets and collect world cup trophies along the way. There will be a specific amount of goals needed to score and world cup trophies to be collected in order to advance to the next level which will be a new map of another famous football stadium.However there will be enemies which you will have to fight with your fire or avoid to get to your goal. As you progress levels will get harder with different platforms and enemies, and you will have to get to stadium doors quick to advance.
